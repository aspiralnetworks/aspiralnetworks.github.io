									</p>

									<ol>
										<li>Order Cancellation</li>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Customers may request cancellations within a time frame set by ASPIRAL NETWORKS PRIVATE LIMITED, which may be updated from 
												time to time. This allows for accidental purchases to be rectified while ensuring sellers are 
												not inconvenienced by last-minute cancellations.
											</li>
											<li>
												If an order has already been accepted by the seller, the customer cannot cancel the order
												under any circumstances.
											</li>
											<li>
												Sellers have the right to cancel orders at any time before they are marked as completed due
												to unavailability, operational constraints, or other valid reasons.
											</li>
											<li>
												ASPIRAL NETWORKS PRIVATE LIMITED reserves the right to remove or modify the order cancellation feature from
												the customer application/website at any time without prior notice.
											</li>
											<li>
												Exclusions: Orders containing perishable items such as flowers, food, or similar consumables
												cannot be canceled once placed. However, in cases where the delivered product is found to be
												defective or of poor quality, customers may be eligible for a refund or replacement
												(refer to the Refund Policy below).
											</li>
										</ul>

										<li>Refund Policy</li>

										<body>
											ASPIRAL NETWORKS PRIVATE LIMITED does not sell or buy products directly but provides a technology platform to connect
											buyers and sellers. Therefore, refunds are subject to the policies of the respective sellers.
											However, we facilitate the process by ensuring transparency and fair resolution.
										</body>

										<body>
											Refunds may be processed in the following cases:
										</body>
										<ul>

												Damaged or Defective Products: If a product is received in a damaged or defective
												condition, customers must report it to our Customer Service team within 30 minutes of
												delivery.

											<li>
												Mismatched Products: If the product received does not match the description or
												expectations, customers must raise a request within 30 minutes of receipt.
											</li>

												Order Non-Fulfillment: If a seller is unable to fulfill an order due to stock
												unavailability, logistical issues, or other unforeseen circumstances, customers
												will be entitled to a full refund.
											</li>
											<li>
												Refund Processing Time: If a refund request is approved, it may take 16-30 business
												days for the amount to be credited back to the original payment method,
												depending on the banking and payment gateway processing times.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<li>Non-Refundable Situations</li>

												accepted by the seller, no refunds will be provided.
											</li>
											<li>
												Service Issues: ASPIRAL NETWORKS PRIVATE LIMITED does not take responsibility for product quality or
												service-related complaints as it is only a platform facilitating transactions.
												Customers are advised to resolve such disputes directly with the seller.
											</li>
											<li>
												Manufacturer Warranty Claims: If a product is covered by a manufacturerâ€™s warranty,
												customers should contact the manufacturer directly for any issues instead of

										<ul>
											<li>
												If a replacement is required due to a damaged or defective product, it must be

												and product availability.
											</li>
											<li>
												Customers must return the product in its original packaging with all accessories
												and labels intact.
											</li>
											<li>
												Exchanges are subject to approval by the seller, and ASPIRAL NETWORKS PRIVATE LIMITED will
												facilitate communication but does not guarantee an exchange outcome.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<li>Dispute Resolution Assistance</li>
										<ul>
											<li>
												ASPIRAL NETWORKS PRIVATE LIMITED does not take direct responsibility for the resolution of disputes

											</li>
											<li>
												Customers and sellers are expected to resolve disputes amicably based on the information
												provided by ASPIRAL NETWORKS PRIVATE LIMITED.
											</li>
											<li>
												If a dispute arises regarding non-receipt, damaged goods, or incorrect items, we
												recommend that buyers first reach out to the seller directly via the platform.
											</li>
											<li>
												If no resolution is reached, ASPIRAL NETWORKS PRIVATE LIMITED will provide mediation support
												but will not be responsible for enforcing refunds or compensations.
											</li>
										</ul>
